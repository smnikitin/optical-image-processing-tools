## 📸 Introduction

This project includes a variety of small tools for image processing tasks. Each script is modular and can be easily adapted for your own use cases.

### Available Tools:

- **Cross-section Plotting**  
  Plot intensity values across a specific line of a grayscale image.

- **Linear Regression (lin_reg)**  
  Analyze trends and apply linear regression to image-based data.

- **FFT (Fast Fourier Transform)**  
  Visualize the frequency components of an image.

## 🧠 Features

- Use your **keyboard** to interact with tools
- Runs in **Windows** environments
- Modular and beginner-friendly scripts
- Built with common Python libraries

---

## 📦 Installation

1. Clone this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/smnikitin/img_proc_tools.git
cd img_proc_tools
```

2. Install the required Python libraries:
```bash
pip install numpy matplotlib Pillow
```

---

## 🚀 Usage

1. Open and modify one of the tool scripts (like `cross-section.py`) to suit your needs.
2. Make sure the path to your grayscale image is correct.
3. Run the script:
```bash
python example.py
```
4. You’ll see the image and a live plot. Use the arrow keys to move the cross-section and explore intensity values.
